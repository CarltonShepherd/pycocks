A Python implementation of [Cocks' identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocks_IBE_scheme) [1].

Cocks' scheme uses the quadratic residuosity hardness problem, rather than bilinear pairings with other IBE schemes, e.g. Boneh-Franklin [2]. 

As a result, no additional dependencies are required for pairing-based cryptography; only gmpy2 is sufficient.

## Usage

Two classes are utilised for server- and client-side communication:

1. (Server) ```CocksPKG```: implements the public key generator (PKG) for the scheme's initialisation and extracting secret keys from identity strings.

2. (Client) ```Cocks```: used for encrypting and decrypting messages using the secret key and public modulus generated by ```CocksPKG```.

```python
from pycocks.cocks import CocksPKG, Cocks

cocks_pkg = CocksPKG()   # Optional param.: bit size (default = 2048)

# Extract private key, r, from an identity string; a transformed
# ID string, a, is also returned, which is required for encryption
# and decryption.
r, a = cocks_pkg.extract("User1")

cocks = Cocks(cocks_pkg.n)  # Must use same public modulus, n, from cocks_pkg
c = cocks.encrypt(b"test", a)
msg = cocks.decrypt(c, r, a)  # => b"test"
```

## Tests

Use ```pytest``` to execute tests in ```tests/test_pycocks.py```

## Requirements

- gmpy2 (tested v2.0.8)
